Hi, my name is Joseph, currently based in Oakland, CA.

I'm a Psychiatric Occupational Therapist turned Software Engineer with multiple years of experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, and Python. Patient and stubbornly curious, I am passionate about clear systematic thinking and the power of persistent, intentioned effort.
