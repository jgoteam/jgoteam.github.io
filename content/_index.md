Iâ€™m a full-stack Software Engineer with multiple years of experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, and Python. Based in San Francisco, CA.

Recently, I built [Syncosaurus](https://syncosaurus.github.io), an open-source, serverless framework for real-time collaborative applications, featuring a synchronization system utilizing [client-side prediction and server reconciliation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_prediction).
