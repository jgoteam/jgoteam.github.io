# Hi, I'm Joseph!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack Software Engineer with multiple years of experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, and Python. Previously, I was a Psychiatric Occupational Therapist, where equanimity, adaptability, and strong communications skills were critical. Patient and stubbornly curious, I am passionate about clear systematic thinking and the power of persistent, intentioned effort.

Recently, I built [Syncosaurus](https://syncosaurus.github.io), an open-source, serverless framework for real-time collaborative applications, featuring a synchronization system that utilizes client-side prediction and server reconciliation.
