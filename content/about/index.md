Hi there, I'm Joseph, a Software Engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Currently, I'm excited about the [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) space and machine learning. I'm steadily making my way through Jeremy Howard's [Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/) course.

Previously, I worked in the healthcare and mental health settings as an [Occupational Therapist](https://www.aota.org/about/what-is-ot), where I developed, planned, and implemented the first occupational therapy program at a psychiatric health facility in Oakland, CA.

Outside of work, I'm fond of:

- my two cats 🐱
- tea (especially sencha and tulsi) 🍵
- weightlifting ([kettlebell carries](https://strongmadesimple.com/blog/2014/6/12-loaded-carries-with-kettlebells) woohoo!) 💪
- instrumental [shreddery](https://youtu.be/q0ZrF7taMHA?si=S5ByW4_PXenfrUeG) 🎵

I'm looking for my next opportunity as a Software Engineer. Let's [connect](/about/#contact) if you think I'd be a good fit for your team!
