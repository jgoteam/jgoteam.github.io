Hi there, I'm Joseph I am a German living in California.

I’m a developer by trade and by heart ❤️. I enjoy tinkering around with code and sometimes I talk about it. I have particularly strong opinions on blockchain technologies. All my posts regarding this topic can be found under Schlockchain. All other articles can be found under blog.

For my professional credentials refer to my LinkedIn Page.

Besides friends, family and my amazing wife here are some other things I love:

- Videos of Baby Hedgehogs Yawning
- Puns on my first name (It’s pronounced like ’life')
- EDM Remixes of Philipp Poisel Songs
- Punk rock albums released during the Bush era
- Craft beer that tastes like mango
